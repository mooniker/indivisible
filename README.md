# Indivisible (playing with prime numbers)

These functions are for reminding me to determine whether a number is prime and for getting a sequence of prime numbers.

- `is_prime`/`isPrime` functions check whether a given integer is prime
- `get_how_many_prime_numbers`/`getHowManyPrimeNumbers` functions return an array in the given length of sequential prime numbers

# Testing

The first 168 prime numbers are (copy/pasted [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)) into `prime_numbers.csv` for testing (`test.py`, `test.js`, etc) the algorithms.
